<p> <strong> Teaching: </strong> As an undergraduate in Spring 2019, I taught freshman algebra at McQueen High School in Reno, Nevada for two months as part of an apprenticeship; my mentor teachers were Judy Ashby and Glenn Waddell. I have been a teaching assistant at the University of Nevada, Reno from Fall 2019 to Spring 2020, and then Fall 2021 to the present. 
  As a teaching assistant, I lead recitations for Precalculus II (MATH 127), Calculus I (MATH 181) and Calculus II (MATH 182). The specifics are given below.</p>
